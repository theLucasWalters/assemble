# Python Assemble Module
I don't know if I can actually call this a module, but whatever.

Basically, assembling Assembly files is hard on Windows. Now it's not. Have fun!

## How I use this
I used `pyinstaller` to compile the script into a `.exe` and added that to my path so I can use it wherever I want. Works like a charm!

**This is meant for x64 Windows with MASM installed*
